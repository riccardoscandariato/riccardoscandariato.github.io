<h2>Very condensed CV</h2>

<p>I received my PhD in Computer Science in 2004 from Politecnico di Torino, Italy. 
In my academic career I had the opportunity to work in several countries, including the United States (<strong>University of Virginia</strong>, 2003), Italy (<strong>Politecnico di Torino</strong>, 2004-2005), Belgium (<strong>KU Leuven</strong>, 2006-2014) and Sweden (<strong>University of Gothenburg</strong>, 2014-2020).
Since late 2020, I'm the head of the Institute of Software Security at the <strong>Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH)</strong>, in Germany.</p>

<h2>Research interests</h2>

<p>
Together with my team, I apply an inter-disciplinary approach to create innovative tools and techniques to design and implement secure and privacy-friendly applications. 
My target application domains are micro-services, Internet-of-Things ecosystems, and cyber-physical systems. 
While my main interest is in the technical aspects of software security, I also investigate how security techniques can be made more effective and usable for the developers. 
My core research topics are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Software vulnerability repair</li>
<li>Localization and prediction of software vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Localization of security features in application software</li>
<li>Generation of secure code</li>
<li>Model-based security and threat analysis</li>
<li>Usable security and privacy</li>
</ul>
<p>In this research agenda, an important role is played by the use of ML/AI to solve cybersecurity challenges.
My work is also characterized by the systematic use of empirical methods for security, including controlled experiments and mining software repositories.</p>


<h2>Team</h2>
