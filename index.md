<p>I'm a full professor<sup><a href="#section1">1</a></sup> and the head of the <strong>Institute of Software Security</strong> at the <a href="https://www.tuhh.de/alt/tuhh/startpage.html" target="_blank">Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH)</a>, in Germany. I also hold a part-time position as full professor of software engineering at the University of Gothenburg, in Sweden.</p>

<p>I'm a father of two boys and spend my (limited) spare time taking <a href="https://riccardoscandariato.github.io/photos" target="_blank">photographs</a>.</p>

<p>My favorite saying is <em>"done is better than perfect"</em>.

<p>I don't have Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, you name it...</p>



<h2>Research interests</h2>

<p>My work focuses on the design of secure and privacy-friendly applications, particularly in the realms of &mu;-services, IoT ecosystems, and cyber-physical systems (e.g., automotive). 
My research goal is to build <strong>round-trip security &amp; privacy engineering methods</strong>, which are based on lightweight design models and connect the design models with the implementation code. 
In this research agenda, an important role is played by the use of ML/AI, as well as the adoption security-oriented intelligent agents.
My work is also characterized by the systematic use of <strong>empirical methods for security</strong>, including controlled experiments and mining software repositories.
</p>


<h2>Very condensed CV</h2>

<p>I received my PhD in Computer Science in 2004 from Politecnico di Torino, Italy. 
In my academic career I had the opportunity to work in several countries, including the United States (<strong>University of Virginia</strong>, 2003), Italy (<strong>Politecnico di Torino</strong>, 2004-2005), Belgium (<strong>KU Leuven</strong>, 2006-2014) and Sweden (<strong>University of Gothenburg</strong>, 2014-2020).
Since late 2020, I'm the head of the Institute of Software Security at the <strong>Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH)</strong>, in Germany.</p>

<h2>Supervision</h2>

<p>Working with young researchers (particularly, PhD students) is one the perks of being a professor. It's something I truly enjoy and dedicate time to. In 2020, I've received a <strong> honorable mention as Supervisor of the Year</strong> at the Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, a prize given by the association of the doctoral students. The motivation says: <blockquote>"His consideration, communication skills and knowledge come together in a very friendly and focussed approach to supervision."</blockquote></p> 

<p>In Germany, I have the pleasure of supervising the following PhD students:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Catherine Tony</strong>, (PhD student) working on innovative dev-bots assisting software developers in the creation of secure and privacy-friendly applications</li>
<li><strong>Cuong Bui Quang</strong>, (PhD student) working on automated security and privacy repairs at both model and code level</li>
<li><strong>Komal Kashish</strong>, (PhD student) working on the design and implementation of secure and privacy friendly applications in the domain of Internet of Things (IoT)</li>
</ul>

<p>In Sweden, I have the privilege of collaborating with these brilliant researchers:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.rodijolak.com" target="_blank">Rodi Jolak</a>, (PostDoc) working on resilience of automotive systems</li>
<li><a href="https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=UsHTVwkAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Mazen Mohamad</a>, (PhD student) working on security assurance cases for automotive</li>	
<li>Tomasz Kosinski, (PhD student) working on privacy of IoT (I'm his co-supervisor)</li>
</ul>

<p>In the past, I also worked with these bright individuals:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/katja-tuma" target="_blank">Dr. Katja Tuma</a>, graduated in January 2021 (University of Gothenburg) with a PhD thesis titled <strong>Efficiency and Automation in Threat Analysis of Software Systems</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/people/alex" target="_blank">Dr. Alexander van den Berghe</a>, graduated in March 2020 (KU Leuven) with a PhD thesis titled <strong>SMILE: A Security-Centric, Formally-Founded Modelling Language for Humans</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Mt9ot9UAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Kim Wuyts</a>, graduated in January 2014 (KU Leuven) with a PhD thesis titled <strong>Privacy Threats in Software Architectures</strong></li>
