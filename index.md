<h2>Research interests</h2>

<!--
<p>My work focuses on the design of secure and privacy-friendly applications, particularly in the realms of &mu;-services, IoT ecosystems, and cyber-physical systems (e.g., automotive). 
My research goal is to build <strong>round-trip security &amp; privacy engineering methods</strong>, which are based on lightweight design models and connect the design models with the implementation code. 
In this research agenda, an important role is played by the use of ML/AI, as well as the adoption security-oriented intelligent agents.
My work is also characterized by the systematic use of <strong>empirical methods for security</strong>, including controlled experiments and mining software repositories.
</p>

<p>
Together with my team, I apply an inter-disciplinary approach to create innovative tools and techniques to design and implement secure and privacy-friendly applications. 
My target application domains are micro-services, Internet-of-Things ecosystems, and cyber-physical systems. 
While my main interest is in the technical aspects of software security, I also investigate how security techniques can be made more effective and usable for the developers. 
My core research topics are:
<ul>
<li>Model-based security</li>
<li>Program repair for software security</li>
<li>Benchmarking security features in application software</li>
<li>Prediction of software vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Threat and risk analysis</li>
<li>Usable security and privacy</li>
</ul>
In this research agenda, an important role is played by the use of ML/AI to solve cybersecurity challenges.
My work is also characterized by the systematic use of empirical methods for security, including controlled experiments and mining software repositories.

<h2>Very condensed CV</h2>

<p>I received my PhD in Computer Science in 2004 from Politecnico di Torino, Italy. 
In my academic career I had the opportunity to work in several countries, including the United States (<strong>University of Virginia</strong>, 2003), Italy (<strong>Politecnico di Torino</strong>, 2004-2005), Belgium (<strong>KU Leuven</strong>, 2006-2014) and Sweden (<strong>University of Gothenburg</strong>, 2014-2020).
Since late 2020, I'm the head of the Institute of Software Security at the <strong>Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH)</strong>, in Germany.</p>

<h2>Team</h2>

<p>Working with young researchers is one the perks of being a professor. It's something I truly enjoy and dedicate time to. I have the privilege of supervising the following research associates:</p>
<ul>
<!-- li><strong>Anusha Bambhore Tukaram</strong>, working on security analysis of microservice application software</li -->
<li><strong>Catherine Tony</strong>, working on automatic generation of secure and privacy-friendly application code</li>
<li><strong>Cuong Bui Quang</strong>, working on automated program repair techniques for security vulnerabilities</li>
<!-- li><strong>Komal Kashish</strong>, working on the design and implementation of secure applications in the domain of Internet of Things (IoT)</li -->
<li><strong>Simon Schneider</strong>, working on lightweight techniques to identify security features in application code (e.g., microservices)</li>
<li><strong>Torge Hinrichs</strong>, working on predicting software vulnerabilities via machine learning</li>
<!-- , co-supervised with <a href="https://www.haw-hamburg.de/en/university/employees/detail/person/person/show/bettina-buth/172/" target="_blank">Prof. Bettina Buth</a> of HAW Hamburg</li -->
</ul>

<p>The team is also inspired by the excellent work of our senior researchers:
<ul>
<li><strong>Nicolas Diaz Ferreyra</strong> is a post-doctoral researcher working on privacy.</li>	
</ul>

<p>I have also the pleasure of co-supervising these brilliant researchers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mazen Mohamad</strong>, PhD student working on security assurance cases for automotive at the University of Gothenburg, under the main supervision of <a href="https://jpsteghofer.net" target="_blank">Prof. Jan-Philipp Stegh&ouml;fer</a></li>
<li><strong>Max Neuendorf</strong>, PhD fast-track student at the University of Hamburg, under the main supervision of <a href="https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/inst/ab/snp/team/fischer.html" target="_blank">Prof. Mathias Fisher</a></li>	
</ul>
