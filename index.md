    <strong><i class="fas fa-anchor"></i> I'm hiring, come to Hamburg <i class="fas fa-anchor"></i></strong> I have several positions available at both PhD and PostDoc level. If interested, please send me an email with your CV and a statement of why you want to get a PhD (with me).
    </div>

<p>I'm a full professor<sup><a href="#section1">1</a></sup> and the head of the <b>Institute of Secure Software</b> at the <a href="https://www.tuhh.de/alt/tuhh/startpage.html" target="_blank">Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH)</a>, in Germany. I also hold a part-time position as full professor of software engineering at the University of Gothenburg, in Sweden.</p>

<p>I'm a father of two boys and spend my (limited) spare time taking <a href="http://www.scandariato.photo" target="_blank">photographs</a>.</p>

<p>My favorite saying is <em>"done is better than perfect"</em>.

<p>I don't have Twitter, LinkedIn, ResearchGate, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, you name it...</p>



<h2>Research interests</h2>

<p>My work focuses on the design of secure applications, particularly in the realms of &mu;-services and IoT ecosystems. 
My research goal is to build <b>round-trip security &amp; privacy engineering methods</b>, which are based on lightweight design models and connect the design models with the implementation code. 
In this research agenda, an important role is played by the use of ML/AI, as well as the adoption security-oriented intelligent agents.
My work is also characterized by the systematic use of <b>empirical methods for security</b>, including controlled experiments and mining software repositories.
</p>


<h2>Very condensed CV</h2>

<p>I received my PhD in Computer Science in 2004 from Politecnico di Torino, Italy. 
In my academic career I had the opportunity to work in several countries, including the United States (<b>University of Virginia</b>, 2003), Italy (<b>Politecnico di Torino</b>, 2004-2005), Belgium (<b>KU Leuven</b>, 2006-2014) and Sweden (<b>University of Gothenburg</b>, 2014-2020).
Since late 2020, I'm the head of the Institute of Secure Software at the <b>Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH)</b>, in Germany.</p>

<h2>Supervision</h2>

<p>Working with young researchers (particularly, PhD students) is one the perks of being a professor. It's something I truly enjoy and dedicate time to. In 2020, I've received a <b> honorable mention as Supervisor of the Year</b> at the Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, a prize given by the association of the doctoral students. The motivation says: <blockquote>"His consideration, communication skills and knowledge come together in a very friendly and focussed approach to supervision."</blockquote></p> 

<p>In Sweden, I have the privilege of collaborating with the following researchers:</p>
