I've worked on the following experimental studies:

<ul>
	<li>Which vulnerability reports are better to fix security bugs: static analysis or pen testing? Published at ESEM 2016</li>
	<li>Which techniques for secure design are available? This systematic literature review has been published in  the Journal of Software and Systems Modeling.</li>
	<li>Do security patterns produce more secure software? Published at ICSE'15 [<a href="http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~koen.yskout/icse15/" target="_blank">more info</a>]</li>
	<li>Comparing text mining to software metrics as predictors of vulnerabilities. Published at ISSRE'14 [<a href="http://seam.cs.umd.edu/webvuldata/" target="_blank">more info</a>], at IEEE Transactions on Reliability, and at ESEM 2016</li>
	<li>Predicting Vulnerable Software Components via Text Mining (for Android apps). Published in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering in 2014 [<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/textminingandroid/" target="_blank">more info</a>]</li>
	<li>Empirical Evaluation of a Privacy-Focused Threat Modeling Methodology (100 students + 7 professionals). Published in Journal of Systems and Software in 2014 [<a href="https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/software/linddun/" target="_blank">more info</a>]</li>
	<li>A descriptive study of Microsoft's threat modeling technique (57 subjects, 5th year master students). Published in Requirements Engineering in 2013 [<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/descriptivestudy/" target="_blank">more info</a>]</li>
