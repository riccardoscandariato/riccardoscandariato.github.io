I'm an &nbsp;<b>associate professor</b>&nbsp;at the Software Engineering Division of the Chalmers University of Technology and the University of <b>Gothenburg (GU)</b>, in <b>Sweden</b>. I'm also affiliated with the DistriNet Research Group (KU Leuven, Belgium) as a part-time Research Expert in secure software. My main research interests are in the area of Secure Software Engineering, with focus on:

<ul>
	<li><b style="font-weight:bold">Privacy-by-design </b>and <b>security-by-design</b> (threat analysis, precise modeling and analysis of security &amp; privacy properties in software architecture, patterns)</li>
	<li><b>Empirical methods for security</b> (controlled experiments and mining software repositories)</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm also the <b>Program Coordinator</b> (a.k.a. MPA) for the GU's master program "<a href="http://cse.gu.se/english/education/se120hec" target="_blank">Software Engineering and Management</a>" and the Chalmes' master program "<a href="http://www.chalmers.se/en/education/programmes/masters-info/Pages/Software-Engineering-and-Technology.aspx" target="_blank">Software Engineering and Technology</a>".</p>

<p>I spend my <b>spare time</b> taking photographs (see my <a href="http://www.essphotos.com" target="_blank"><b>photos</b></a> here) and playing tennis.</p>

<h2><a name="TOC-Short-bio"></a>Short bio</h2>
<p>Prof. Riccardo Scandariato received his PhD in Computer Science in 2004 from Politecnico di Torino, Italy. In 2005, he was a post-doctoral researcher at Politecnico di Torino, with the Software Engineering research group. In 2006, he joined the DistriNet research group at KU Leuven, Belgium. In Leuven, he became the leader of a team of researchers in the area of secure software. In 2014, he moved to Gothenburg (Sweden) and joined the department of Computer Science and Engineering, which is shared between the Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg.</p>
<p>Prof. Scandariato's main research interests are in the area of secure software engineering, with a particular focus on (i) privacy&amp;security by design and <span style="background-color:transparent">(ii) empirical methods for security</span><span style="background-color:transparent">. He has published over 65 papers in the area of security and software engineering. He is an Associate Editor of the International Journal of Secure Software Engineering (IJSSE) and a member of the Review Editorial Board of Frontiers in ICT. He regularly participates to the Program Committees of several top-rated conferences in the area of security and software engineering.</span></p>

I am often busy performing <b>controlled experiments</b> (with human participants) about secure software engineering techniques.
<div><br />
<div>I also routinely collaborate on studies that <b>mine software repositories</b> and use <b>machine learning</b> to <b>predict vulnerable software</b> components.</div>
