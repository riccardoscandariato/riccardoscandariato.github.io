I'm a <b>professor of software engineering</b> at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, <a href="https://www.gu.se/english/about_the_university/staff/?languageId=100001&disableRedirect=true&returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gu.se%2Fomuniversitetet%2Fpersonal%2F%3FuserId%3Dxscari%26departmentId%3D107833&userId=xscari&departmentId=107833" target="_blank">University of Gothenburg</a> and <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/Staff/Pages/riccardo-scandariato.aspx" target="_blank">Chalmers University of Technology</a>, in Sweden. My main research interests are in the area of secure software engineering, with focus on:

<ul>
	<li><b>Privacy-by-design</b> and <b>security-by-design</b> (threat analysis, precise modeling and analysis of security &amp; privacy properties in software architecture, patterns)</li>
	<li><b>Empirical methods for security</b> (controlled experiments and mining software repositories)</li>
</ul>

<p>I spend my <b>spare time</b> taking photographs (see my <a href="http://www.scandariato.photo" target="_blank"><b>photos</b></a> here).</p>

<h2>Under the spotlight</h2>

<blockquote>

	Our work on <a href="https://linddun.org" target="_blank">privacy threat modeling</a> is favorably mentioned by <b>Adam Shostack</b> in his new book <a href="http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118809998.html" target="_blank">Threat Modeling: Designing for Security</a>:
<ul>
	<li><i>"LINDDUN is, in many ways, one of the most serious and thought-provoking approaches to privacy threat modeling, and those seriously interested in privacy should take a look at it."</i></li>
</ul>

We have published a systematic literature review comparing several techniques for threat analysis in the <b>Journal of Systems and Software</b>

<h2>Short bio</h2>
<p>Prof. Riccardo Scandariato received his PhD in Computer Science in 2004 from Politecnico di Torino, Italy. In 2005, he was a post-doctoral researcher at Politecnico di Torino, with the Software Engineering research group. In 2006, he joined the DistriNet research group at KU Leuven, Belgium. 
<!-- In Leuven, he became the leader of a team of researchers in the area of secure software. -->
In 2014, he moved to Gothenburg (Sweden) and joined the department of Computer Science and Engineering, which is shared between the Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg.</p>
<p>Prof. Scandariato's main research interests are in the area of secure software engineering, with a particular focus on (i) privacy &amp; security by design and (ii) empirical methods for security. He has published over 80 papers in the area of security and software engineering. 
<!--He is an Associate Editor of the International Journal of Secure Software Engineering (IJSSE) and a member of the Review Editorial Board of Frontiers in ICT. -->
He regularly participates to the Program Committees of several top-rated conferences in the area of security and software engineering.</p>


<h2>Publications</h2>

<p>I am the co-author of <b>over 80 publications</b>. <a href="/pubs">Click here</a> for a complete list. This is my <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xul68AwAAAAJ&amp;hl" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a> page.</p>


<!--
<h2>Empirical work</h2>

<p>I am often busy performing <b>controlled experiments</b> (with human participants) about secure software engineering techniques.</p>

<p>I also routinely collaborate on studies that <b>mine software repositories</b> and use <b>machine learning</b> to <b>predict vulnerable software</b> components.</p>
