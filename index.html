I'm a <b>professor of software engineering</b> at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, <a href="https://www.gu.se/english/about_the_university/staff/?languageId=100001&disableRedirect=true&returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gu.se%2Fomuniversitetet%2Fpersonal%2F%3FuserId%3Dxscari%26departmentId%3D107833&userId=xscari&departmentId=107833" target="_blank">University of Gothenburg</a> and <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/Staff/Pages/riccardo-scandariato.aspx" target="_blank">Chalmers University of Technology</a>, in Sweden. My main research interests are in the area of secure software engineering, with focus on:
<ul>
	<li><b>Privacy-by-design</b> and <b>security-by-design</b> (threat analysis, precise modeling and analysis of security &amp; privacy properties in software architecture)</li>
	<li><b>Empirical methods for security</b> (controlled experiments and mining software repositories)</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm a father of two boys and spend my (limited) spare time <a href="http://www.scandariato.photo" target="_blank">taking photographs</a>.</p>

<p>My favorite saying is <i>"done is better than perfect"</i>.

<p>I don't have Twitter, LinkedIn, ResearchGate, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, you name it...</p>

<h2>Short bio</h2>

<p>Prof. Riccardo Scandariato received his PhD in Computer Science in 2004 from Politecnico di Torino, Italy. In 2005, he was a post-doctoral researcher at Politecnico di Torino, with the Software Engineering research group. In 2006, he joined the DistriNet research group at KU Leuven, Belgium. 
In 2014, he moved to Gothenburg (Sweden) and joined the department of Computer Science and Engineering, which is shared between the Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg.</p>
<p>Prof. Scandariato's main research interests are in the area of secure software engineering, with a particular focus on (i) privacy &amp; security by design and (ii) empirical methods for security. He has published over 80 papers in the area of security and software engineering. 
He regularly participates to the Program Committees of several top-rated conferences in the area of security and software engineering.</p>


<h2>Research team</h2>

<p>Working with young researchers (particularly, PhD students) is one the perks of being a professor. It's something I truly enjoy and dedicate time to. In 2020, I've received a <b> honorable mention as Supervisor of the Year</b> at the Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, a prize given by the association of the doctoral students. The motivation says: <blockquote>"His consideration, communication skills and knowledge come together in a very friendly and focussed approach to supervision."</blockquote></p> 

<p>I have the privilege of working together with the following researchers:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/katja-tuma" target="_blank">Katja Tuma</a>, (PhD student) working on security threat assessment of automotive software</li>
<li><a href="https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=UsHTVwkAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Mazen Mohamad</a>, (PhD student) working on security assurance cases for automotive</li>	
<li><a href="https://cse.gu.se/om/interaktionsdesign/forskare/tomasz-kosinski" target="_blank">Tomasz Kosinski</a>, (PhD student) working on privacy of IoT</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rodijolak.com" target="_blank">Rodi Jolak</a>, (PostDoc) working on resilience of automotive systems</li>
</ul>


<!--
<h2>Teaching</h2>

I created (and teach) a new project course (15 credits) on <strong>"production ML systems"</strong> for the <a href="https://cse.gu.se/english/education/se180credits" target="_blank">Bachelor program in Software Engineering and Management</a> at the University of Gothenburg. The course official title is "Software Engineering for Data-Intensive AI Applications (DIT824)".
